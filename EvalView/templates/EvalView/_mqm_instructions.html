                Seriously affects the understandability, reliability, or usability of the content for its intended

        <strong>Score: </strong>
        Highlighting more errors or changing their severity levels automatically updates the translation quality score on the slider. After highlighting all errors, before continuing to the next screen, please manually update this score to better reflect your judgement. The quality levels associated with numerical scores on the slider:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0: No meaning preserved</strong>: Nearly all information is lost between the translation and
            source. Grammar is irrelevant.</li>
          <li><strong>4: Some meaning preserved</strong>: The translation preserves some of the meaning of the source
            but misses significant parts. The narrative is hard to follow due to fundamental errors. Grammar may be
            poor.</li>
          <li><strong>6: Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes</strong>: The translation retains most of the
            meaning. It may have some grammar mistakes or minor contextual inconsistencies.</li>
          <li><strong>10: Perfect meaning and grammar</strong>: The meaning of the translation is completely consistent
            with the source the context. The grammar is also correct.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
