                significantly change the meaning or reduce the fluency of the text. They might be small mistakes in
                grammar, spelling, or punctuation that do not greatly affect the overall quality of the translation.

        <strong>Score: </strong>
        The translation score is automatically recomputed based on your marked spans.
        However, in many cases it does reflect well the overall translation quality.
        Please, update the translation score before continuing to the next segment.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0: No meaning preserved</strong>: Nearly all information is lost between the translation and
            source. Grammar is irrelevant.</li>
          <li><strong>4: Some meaning preserved</strong>: The translation preserves some of the meaning of the source
            but misses significant parts. The narrative is hard to follow due to fundamental errors. Grammar may be
            poor.</li>
          <li><strong>6: Most meaning preserved and few grammar mistakes</strong>: The translation retains most of the
            meaning. It may have some grammar mistakes or minor contextual inconsistencies.</li>
          <li><strong>10: Perfect meaning and grammar</strong>: The meaning of the translation is completely consistent
            with the source the context. The grammar is also correct.</li>
