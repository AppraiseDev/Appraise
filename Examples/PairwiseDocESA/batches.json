The plaintiff lived for many years in the Netherlands, near Aachen. She had completed her training as a cross-border commuter in Aachen, but was never subject to social security contributions. She had two children whom she had raised in the Netherlands and was not working during this time. It was not until many years later that she moved to Germany and paid into the pension fund for the first time. <h2>No difference between education at home and abroad</h2> When the woman became unable to work, the German pension insurance did not count the child-rearing period in the Netherlands against her pension entitlement. The European Court of Justice takes a different view: for the purposes of crediting, it depends on whether there is a \"sufficient connection\" between the child-rearing period abroad and the insurance period in Germany. This criterion has already been developed by the ECJ in previous decisions. For this reason, it has been clear for some time that child-rearing periods in other EU countries must also be taken into account when calculating pensions. What is new, however, is that there is a \"sufficient connection\" even if the person concerned did not pay any contributions to the pension insurance scheme before the child-rearing period abroad."

Erst viele Jahre sp\u00e4ter zog sie nach Deutschland und zahlte dann erstmals in die Rentenkasse ein. <h2>Kein Unterschied zwischen Erziehung im In- und Ausland</h2> Als die Frau erwerbsunf\u00e4hig wurde, rechnete die Deutsche Rentenversicherung die Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht auf ihren Rentenanspruch an. Der Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof sieht das anders: F\u00fcr die Anrechnung kommt es darauf an, ob zwischen der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland und der Versicherungszeit im Inland eine \"hinreichende Verbindung\" besteht. Dieses Kriterium hat der EuGH bereits in fr\u00fcheren Entscheidungen entwickelt. Deswegen war schon l\u00e4nger klar, dass grunds\u00e4tzlich auch Kindererziehungszeiten im EU-Ausland bei der Rentenberechnung ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen. Neu ist aber, dass eine \"hinreichende Verbindung\" selbst dann besteht, wenn die Betroffene vor der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland keine Beitr\u00e4ge in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat.",

Arbeitszeiten, die im EU-Ausland verrichtet werden, werden auf den inl\u00e4ndischen Rentenanspruch angerechnet.Doch wer im Ausland Kinder erzogen hat, der muss mitunter um eine Anrechnung der Zeiten auf den Rentenanspruch k\u00e4mpfen. So erging es auch einer Frau aus dem deutsch-niederl\u00e4ndischen Grenzgebiet: Sie hat vor dem Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen geklagt, weil die Deutsche Rentenversicherung ihre Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht anrechnen wollte. Die Kl\u00e4gerin wohnte viele Jahre in den Niederlanden in der N\u00e4he von Aachen. Ihre Ausbildung hatte sie als Grenzg\u00e4ngerin in Aachen absolviert, war aber nie sozialversicherungspflichtig t\u00e4tig. Sie bekam zwei Kinder, die sie in den Niederlanden aufgezogen hatte und war w\u00e4hrenddessen nicht berufst\u00e4tig. Erst viele Jahre sp\u00e4ter zog sie nach Deutschland und zahlte dann erstmals in die Rentenkasse ein. <h2>Kein Unterschied zwischen Erziehung im In- und Ausland</h2> Als die Frau erwerbsunf\u00e4hig wurde, rechnete die Deutsche Rentenversicherung die Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht auf ihren Rentenanspruch an. Der Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof sieht das anders: F\u00fcr die Anrechnung kommt es darauf an, ob zwischen der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland und der Versicherungszeit im Inland eine \"hinreichende Verbindung\" besteht. Dieses Kriterium hat der EuGH bereits in fr\u00fcheren Entscheidungen entwickelt. Deswegen war schon l\u00e4nger klar, dass grunds\u00e4tzlich auch Kindererziehungszeiten im EU-Ausland bei der Rentenberechnung ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen. Neu ist aber, dass eine \"hinreichende Verbindung\" selbst dann besteht, wenn die Betroffene vor der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland keine Beitr\u00e4ge in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat.",

Arbeitszeiten, die im EU-Ausland verrichtet werden, werden auf den inl\u00e4ndischen Rentenanspruch angerechnet.Doch wer im Ausland Kinder erzogen hat, der muss mitunter um eine Anrechnung der Zeiten auf den Rentenanspruch k\u00e4mpfen. So erging es auch einer Frau aus dem deutsch-niederl\u00e4ndischen Grenzgebiet: Sie hat vor dem Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen geklagt, weil die Deutsche Rentenversicherung ihre Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht anrechnen wollte. Die Kl\u00e4gerin wohnte viele Jahre in den Niederlanden in der N\u00e4he von Aachen. Ihre Ausbildung hatte sie als Grenzg\u00e4ngerin in Aachen absolviert, war aber nie sozialversicherungspflichtig t\u00e4tig. Sie bekam zwei Kinder, die sie in den Niederlanden aufgezogen hatte und war w\u00e4hrenddessen nicht berufst\u00e4tig. Erst viele Jahre sp\u00e4ter zog sie nach Deutschland und zahlte dann erstmals in die Rentenkasse ein. <h2>Kein Unterschied zwischen Erziehung im In- und Ausland</h2> Als die Frau erwerbsunf\u00e4hig wurde, rechnete die Deutsche Rentenversicherung die Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht auf ihren Rentenanspruch an. Der Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof sieht das anders: F\u00fcr die Anrechnung kommt es darauf an, ob zwischen der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland und der Versicherungszeit im Inland eine \"hinreichende Verbindung\" besteht. Dieses Kriterium hat der EuGH bereits in fr\u00fcheren Entscheidungen entwickelt. Deswegen war schon l\u00e4nger klar, dass grunds\u00e4tzlich auch Kindererziehungszeiten im EU-Ausland bei der Rentenberechnung ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen.
